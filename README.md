# Food_for_Thought-Challenge
This repository contains some useful algorithms we mentioned in our solutions for the Covid-19 NASA Challenge.

This code can be used to generate the optimal path between two points A and B in an maze.
It can be used only for a one agent problem.
Once run, a Tkinter graphcal user interface is showed, you put the (x,y) coordinates of the start point which refers to the initial position of the vehicle, and then the (x,y) coordinates of the final destination. The lunch button generate automatically the path and shows it on a colored graph.
